The object of the popular casino card game of blackjack is to obtain cards the sum of whose numerical values is as great as possible without exceeding 21. All face cards count as 10, and an ace can count either as 1 or as 11. We consider the version in which each player competes independently against the dealer. The game begins with two cards dealt to both the dealer and the player. One of the dealer's cards is face up and the other is face down. If the player has 21 immediately (an ace and a 10-card), it is called a natural. He then wins unless the dealer also has a natural, in which case the game is a draw. If the player does not have a natural, then he can request additional cards, one by one (*hits*), until he either stops (*sticks*) or exceeds 21(*goes bust*). If he goes bust, he loses; if he sticks, then it becomes the dealer's turn. The dealer hits or sticks according to a fixed strategy without choice: he sticks on any sum of 17 or greater and hits otherwise. If the dealer goes bust, then the player wins; otherwise, the outcome-win, loss,or draw is determined by whose final sum is closer to 21.

Playing blackjack is naturally formulated as an episodic finite MDP. Each game of blackjack is an episode. Rewards of +1, -1, and 0 are given for winning, losing, and drawing, respectively. All rewards within a game are zero, and we do not discount($\gamma$ = 1): therefore these terminal rewards are also the returns. The player's actions are to hit or to stick. The states depend on the player's cards and the dealer's showing card. We assume that cards are dealt from an infinite deck (i.e., with replacement) so that there is no advantage to keeping track of the cards already dealt. If the player holds an ace that he could count as 11 without going bust, then the ace is said to be usable. In this case, it is always counted as 11 because counting it as 1 would make the sum 11 or less, in which case there is no decision to be made because, obviously, the player should always hit. Thus, the player makes decisions on the basis of three variables: his current sum (12-21), the dealer's one showing card (ace-10), and whether or not he holds a usable ace. This makes for a total of 200 states.

States: *(32\*10\*2 array)* 

Players current sum: [0,31] i.e. 32 states

Dealerâ€™s face up card: [1,10] i.e. 10 states

Whether the player has a usable ace or not: [0] or [1] i.e. 2 states

Actions: 

Either stick or hit: [0] or [1] i.e 0 for stick , 1 for hit
